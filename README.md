# acmefmt

This is a clone of [https://github.com/9fans/go/blob/master/acme/acmego/main.go](acmego) by Russ Cox, but instead of goimports and gofmt, it uses `js-beautify` (npm package) for code formatting of `.html`, `.css` and `.js` files.

See LICENSE, which is copied from the https://github.com/9fans/go source tree.
